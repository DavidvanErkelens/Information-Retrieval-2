IWC LIFTS WORLD GRAIN OUTPUT ESTIMATE TO RECORD LONDON March The International Wheat Council IWC lifted its estimate for world wheat and coarse grain production by one mln tonnes to a record mln compared with mln tonnes the previous season In its monthly market report the IWC said it is leaving unchanged its forecast of world wheat production for the coming season at between and mln tonnes against a record mln in The one mln tonne upward revision in wheat production reflects several minor adjustments The IWC raised the coarse grain trade figure two mln to mln tonnes It left wheat trade unchanged at mln The IWC estimate for world trade in wheat and coarse grain is thus estimated two mln tonnes higher at mln against mln the previous season with the forecast three mln rise in Soviet imports offset by small reductions elsewhere The IWC said the area harvested for wheat in is likely to be down from last year as low world prices and restrictive national policies measures begin to take effect At least four of the five major exporters expect to see a drop in wheat sowings without offset in other countries There is still potential for even higher average wheat yields but the IWC said there are increasing signs world output may level off Although it is still early to assess the coarse grain outlook the IWC said barley acreage is likely to fall in the European Community but increase in Canada U S Maize area is expected lower but oat sowings could rise After damage to its maize crop last year the Soviet Union plans to expand this area by as much as pct to over six mln hectares in a year when many frost damaged wheat fields are likely to be resown to this and other spring crops Improved weather and a further increase in the use of intensive cultivation methods could therefore see a marked rise in Soviet maize output in the IWC said Any reduction in world coarse grain output would be bolstered by the large carryover stocks from the IWC said It left its estimates of wheat and coarse grain stocks at end of different marketing years unchanged at and mln tonnes respectively against and mln a year earlier After record world durum wheat production of mln tonnes last season the IWC said there are already signs of another large crop this coming season with higher output expected in the EC Canada the U S And North Africa REUTER
