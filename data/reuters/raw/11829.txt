PROPOSED JAPAN TAX MAY DAMPEN TOKYO GOLD TRADING TOKYO April A proposed sales tax on gold transactions could put a damper on the Tokyo market and encourage a shift of trading to Hong Kong and Singapore senior vice president and Tokyo branch manager of Credit Suisse Paul Hofer told a press conference If you impose five pct on both buy and sell transactions Tokyo participants in the gold market could be out of business he said The tax would create such a spread that Japanese would be unable to compete in the international market he added How can the government really raise taxes if the system they impose is prohibitive of generating business he said The government now imposes a pct tax on physical trades exceeding yen for gold jewellery and coins and a yen tax per yen on futures transactions gold dealers said The new five pct tax would be imposed on companies trading more than mln yen a year and apply to paper gold trades gold deposits with banks and trading of gold bars as well as that of jewellery and coins dealers said However the tax would lower the rate on jewellery and coins to only five pct from the current pct they said Hofer said in Switzerland had imposed a pct gold turnover tax on Jan but abolished it on Oct A study by one of the Swiss banks showed that in early the first year of the tax the volume for all Swiss banks fell by up to pct compared with and Hofer said Transactions of paper gold also fell up to pct of the volume prior to imposition of the tax he said While gold transactions in Switzerland decreased the volume of trades outside the country particularly in London and Luxembourg increased between pct Hofer said Japan is a major importer of gold buying a yearly average just under tonnes gold dealers said Last year Japan imported about tonnes of gold but the government had bought about tonnes for minting coins to commemorate the th year of Emperor Hirohito s reign dealers said Gold trading in Tokyo is dominated mainly by Japanese trading companies while Credit Suisse is the major foreign participant Daily turnover in the Tokyo spot market ranges between one and tonnes with the average around three tonnes while futures turnover amounts to about four tonnes gold dealers said All of us are concerned daily with the fact that the Tokyo market is growing that Japan is becoming one of the three major financial markets in the world And in my personal opinion I think it would be a very big mistake to put a damper on this positive growth or developments by imposing such a tax Hofer said I don t think it fits the philosophy of an internationalising market he added Officials of several major Japanese trading houses attending the press conference said they supported Credit Suisse s call for the government not to impose the gold tax REUTER
