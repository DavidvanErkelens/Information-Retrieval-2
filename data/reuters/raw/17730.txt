TIN TRADERS RESPONSE MUTED TO KL FUTURES MARKET LONDON June European free market tin traders made a somewhat muted response to plans for a Kuala Lumpur dollar based tin futures market due to be launched in October Traders said the new market would probably be a useful trading medium for Japan and other South East Asian tin interests although European traders generally appear to be reasonably satisfied with the current free market system which has been operating since London Metal Exchange LME tin trading ceased in October Dealers here will also want to see how acceptable foreign metal will be on the new market and what sort of demand develops for forward deliveries There is also a view among European traders that while the proposed Kuala Lumpur tin futures market would provide another useful reference point a market inaugurated by the Malaysian government in the past viewed as a major player at times by the trade would make participants uncomfortable Some traders expressed a preference for a resumption of trading on the London Metal Exchange but they added that while there has been some behind the scenes discussion on the subject a definite move is unlikely until outstanding High Court litigation actions have been resolved Spot tin prices on the European free market are currently around stg per tonne for high grade metal in warehouse Rotterdam Over the past months the price moved to a ten year low of stg in March and rebounded to as high as stg in December This compares with stg last paid when LME trading ceased in October and a record high tin price of stg traded for Cash Standard Grade metal in June of that year LME warehouse stocks are now near a two year low at tonnes having fallen steadily from a record high of tonnes reached in February Traders said the free market turned bullish during late last year based on producer forecasts of a supply demand deficit of some tonnes Analysts were predicting prices of up to stg per tonne during However the trend was reversed following a strong upswing in sterling versus the dollar and values fell back briefly to stg last month after approaching stg in December The decline accelerated as producers who had sold very little metal at the higher levels became competitive sellers There was also a lack of significant demand from major steel mills who made large purchases prior to the new year Traders say the ITC creditor banks original tin holdings of nearly tonnes have now been almost halved and the bulk of material still available is being held by Malaysian and Japanese firms which are reluctant to depress the market with unwanted metal Some tonnes were held by banks and brokers after the International Tin Council s ITC buffer stock manager halted support operations on the LME on behalf of the members nations of the International Tin Agreement The overhang of metal was reduced further by broker Shearson Lehman Brothers which earlier this year reported having sold its ITC related holdings and halved its overall tin position Analysts see no immediate sign of a rally in European tin prices and movements are still expected to be largely related to currency fluctuations unless significant consumer demand emerges for the third quarter The Association of Tin Producing Countries ATPC has made efforts since the collapse of the ITA to achieve higher world prices by attempting to bring all major producers under an export control umbrella but to date Brazil and China two major producers remain unaffected by the ATPC argument and apparently are continuing to offer material at discounts to consumers in main European trading centres dealers said Reuter
