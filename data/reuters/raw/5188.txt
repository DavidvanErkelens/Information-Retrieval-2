AUSTRALIAN CURRENT ACCOUNT DEFICIT SEEN NARROWING SYDNEY March Australia s current account deficit for February is expected to narrow to a range of between mln and one billion dlrs from the unrevised January level of billion market economists polled by Reuters said Statistics Bureau February figures are out tomorrow The economists said a key element in the narrowing would be a reversal of the drop in exports which took place in January after a sharp rise in December when the deficit was only mln dlrs As an example they quoted wheat export volume which rose about pct in February after dropping as much in January A lack of aircraft imports in February should also contribute on the trade account although it is still likely to remain in deficit the economists said Other positive influences on the current account balance should be a decline in the invisibles deficit following a seasonal fall in interest payments and the dropping out of certain official aid payments they said They said the Australian dollar which last week touched an eight month high of U S Dlrs but is now around the level should not react adversely to the figures unless the current account shortfall tops one billion dlrs REUTER
