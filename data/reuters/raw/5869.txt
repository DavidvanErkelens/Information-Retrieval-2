DUTCH PORT EMPLOYERS RESUME LAY OFF PLANS ROTTERDAM March Employers in Rotterdam s troubled general cargo sector have decided to restart stalled redundancy procedures within a week employers organisation labour relations manager Gerard Zeebregts told Reuters Port and transport union spokesman Bert Duim said the employers decision would not lead to the immediate resumption of eight weeks of strikes in the sector The strike action was called off on Friday after an interim court injunction against the employers plans for redundancies this year A court in Amsterdam ruled last week the employers had made an error in the complicated procedure for obtaining permission for the redundancies and therefore could not proceed until a final ruling on May Zeebregts said the initiation of new procedure might well take up to two months but the employers were not prepared simply to sit and wait for the May court ruling with the chance they would have to start all over again in any case We cannot afford not to continue with our plans The strikes have already cost a lot of money and damaged business and further delays would do even more damage Zeebregts said The campaign of lightning strikes in the port s general cargo sector began on January in protest at employers plans for redundancies from the sector s strong workforce by starting with this year Reuter
