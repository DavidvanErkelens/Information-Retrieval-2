OECD FARM SUBSIDIES STUDY RESULTS DETAILED By Greg McCune Reuters WASHINGTON March The results of a controversial study of farm subsidies conducted by the Paris based Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development OECD show Japan has the highest agriculture subsidies in the world and that dairy farmers benefit more than any other commodity producers from subsidies Results of the study which has not been released by OECD because of objections from some countries were provided to Reuters by officials of several countries on condition they not be identified The OECD study calculates the level of farm subsidies for the years using a new measure called the producer subsidy equivalent PSE The study shows that on dairy products Japan s PSE or the amount of aid to farmers expressed as a percentage averaged pct over with the European Community at pct and the United States pct For wheat Japan s PSE averaged pct the EC and the U S Japan s rice PSE was pct compared to the EC and the U S pct the OECD calculations show In coarse grains Japan s subsidies reached pct compared with pct for the EC and pct for the U S Japan s beef subsidy was pct versus pct for the EC and pct for the U S OECD concluded For sugar Japan s PSE was pct versus pct in the EC and pct for the U S the study shows The OECD calculated farm subsidies for other industrial countries such as Canada Australia and New Zealand but in most cases the results were much lower than for the U S EC and Japan the sources said Subsidies in Argentina and Brazil two major developing country producers of commodities were not included in the OECD work Officials said they hope to persuade reluctant countries to release the study soon perhaps coinciding with the OECD ministerial meeting in Paris during May Some officials hope the OECD results will be used as a basis for negotiations during the Uruguay round of global trade talks now underway in Geneva British Agriculture Minister Michael Jopling during a visit to Washington this week endorsed the OECD work as a starting point for the Uruguay round negotiations on agriculture He said the PSE calculations provide a tool to negotiate down domestic farm support levels which are a major cause of the present crisis in world agriculture However the OECD study results are controversial because they highlight the levels of assistance to farmers officials familiar with the study said The U S Agriculture Department s Economic Research Service recently published a study of farm subsidies in an attempt to verify the OECD results and update them to In some cases the results were substantially different than the OECD s in part because farm policies in both the U S and elsewhere had changed markedly by from the OECD base period of U S officials said For example the USDA study found the United States subsidies to corn producers were higher in at to pct than in the EC at zero to nine pct French Maize Producers Association president Marcel Cazale citing the result of the USDA calculation for corn told reporters last week that the United States subsidizes its farmers more than the EC However the sources said EC corn subsidies are probably higher than the U S now because of increases since Officials of several countries have been asked to contribute data to OECD so that the study can be updated to subsidy levels a much more relevant measure of the current world farm situation The updated calculations which may take several months to complete are expected to show substantial increases in U S subsidy levels for sugar because the U S imposed restrictive import quotas in as aid to the domestic industry U S subsidy levels also are increased by the farm bill which sharply boosted government deficiency payments to grain farmers and applied a marketing loan for rice officials added Reuter
