ALUMINIUM CAPACITY GROWTH TREND SEEN INSUFFICIENT LONDON March Aluminium capacity expansion planned for the period after will be insufficient to supply any acceleration in demand growth let alone an increase on the scale which seems likely according to analyst Anthony Bird Associates Aluminium Review By non socialist world primary capacity will need to be around mln tonnes whereas on current plans only mln tonnes are scheduled Bird said Bird forecast higher economic growth after and increased imports by less developed countries Aluminium consumption growth is not expected to accelerate by as much as general growth but non socialist world consumption is nevertheless forecast to increase sharply from mln tonnes in to mln tonnes in Bird said Aluminium companies were slow to adjust to the pace of change after the review said and now they have completed this transition they may be in danger of remaining preoccupied with the strategies of retrenchment and survival which have served them well in recent years In order to encourage the construction of additional smelters aluminium prices will need to settle at a higher level Production costs are likely to rise again in the years ahead as the glut of alumina capacity vanishes and electricity suppliers take a more aggressive line with aluminium companies according to the review At March prices the three most likely cost price scenarios call for a long run aluminium price of between and cents a lb depending on exchange rates Bird said Such a price development is not expected to cause any marked competitive problems for the metal because of the likely rise in commodity prices as a whole and cost pressures in the pipeline for steel and copper In the short term however the outlook is dull Bird said as the world economy has not responded well to the opportunities offered by cheap oil Its consumption forecast of mln tonnes is pct down on while production is forecast six pct higher in at mln tonnes Reuter
