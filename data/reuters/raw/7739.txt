GE GE TO RESEARCH COAL FIRED GAS TURBINE POWER EVENDALE Ohio March General Electric Co said its researchers will investigate the potential of a gas turbine powered by the combustion gases of burning coal The company said the research is part of a five year mln dlr program supported by the U S Energy Department s Morgantown Energy Technology Center The center is expected to put up mln dlrs of the cost while GE contributes equipment and services valued at mln dlrs New York State contributes mln dlrs and Norfolk Southern Corp NSC adding mln dlrs Rather than using the conventional gas turbine fuels distillate oil or natural gas GE said the program will look at the feasability of powering a turbine with coal water slurry a mixture of water and finely ground coal particles from which most of the ash has been removed Besides using a cheaper fuel the company said such a system would also be less expensive to build than conventional coal plants which require a boiler in which coal heats water to make steam to drive a turbine or a coal gasifier which converts to coal into gas which is then burned to power a turbine Reuter
