STUDY SHOWS ONLY LIMITED OPTIMISM FOR SILVER ZURICH March Silver looks unlikely to break out of gold and platinum s shadow in the near future although this year is likely to see demand increasing at a faster rate than supply a study by Credit Suisse said The study predicted demand rising by tonnes to tonnes this year against a tonne increase in supply to tonnes This should cut the global oversupply to tonnes from last year s provisional tonnes The study noted that the effects of last year s lower prices were having a dampening effect on total supply which was now back down to around levels of a decade ago However the study said that primary production likely to reach tonnes this year against a provisional in is relatively insensitive to price falls Around a third of silver production comes from heavily indebted Mexico and Peru Price sensitivity is also reduced by the fact that the majority of silver is a by product of other mining activity Reuter
