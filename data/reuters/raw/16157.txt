INSTITUTES DIVIDED ON OUTLOOK FOR GERMAN ECONOMY BONN April The five leading West German economic research institutes have failed to agree about how strongly the domestic economy will expand this year but revised down forecasts contained in a report published six months ago The three research groups of Kiel Hamburg and Essen predicted in the institutes joint spring report that gross national product GNP would rise by two pct in compared with pct in The five institutes had jointly forecast three pct growth in October last year Taking a dissenting view the DIW institute of West Berlin and Munich s Ifo institute predicted only one pct growth The joint report said that the estimates of economic development made by the DIW and Ifo were markedly less favourable than those of the other three The DIW and Ifo forecast the economy would pick up after a slow start to the year In the second half of there will however only be a weak upward movement they said The two institutes said external economic factors which were currently damaging exports and pushing up imports would dominate the economic environment throughout the year They saw exports falling by a real pct in and predicted no marked improvement in the course of the year The other three institutes however wrote The decline in demand and production seen in the winter months does not indicate the beginning of a cyclical downswing They said the sharp rise of the mark had led to corporate uncertainty and companies had not carried out investment plans But they expected that many investments had not been cancelled but only put off It can be presumed that the braking actions on the economy will diminish markedly this year They added The domestic prerequisites for a continuation of the economic uptrend are still favourable These three institutes said diminishing external burdens combined with favourable domestic conditions meant an upturn in demand and production could be expected by the spring However this projection was clouded by risks including the further development of the mark against the dollar Contrary to the DIW and Ifo the three institutes said that while exports would continue to be the weak point of the economy in there is good reason to believe that exports will soon bottom out and that a slight rise will emerge during the course of the year They predicted an overall pct fall in exports in the same as in The three more positive institutes saw private consumption rising by four pct in compared with pct in while DIW and Ifo predicted a three pct increase They saw the climate for equipment investment improving but predicted only a rise of four pct in against pct in Ifo and DIW saw these investments rising by only two pct All the institutes predicted only a slight decline in unemployment The Kiel Hamburg and Essen institutes said the jobless total would average mln in compared with mln in and predicted a rise in the number of people in work of about These three institutes said new jobs would be created mainly in the private services sector and also by the state in the context of job creation measures The construction industry was likely to engage new workers for the first time since but they predicted either no rise in employment in the manufactured goods industry or only a slight expansion The DIW and Ifo said rises in employment would occur only in the tertiary sector while the number employed in the manufacturing industry will decline The DIW and Ifo said unemployment would only decline to mln in from mln in They saw the current account surplus falling in to billion marks from billion in The other three saw a current account surplus in of at least billion marks and predicted that the trade surplus would fall to only around billion marks from billion in The institutes agreed that consumer prices would start to rise in after they declined in and all five predicted an average increase over the year of pct REUTER
