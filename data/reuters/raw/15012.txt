DUTCH SUGAR BEET PLANTING HALF FINISHED ROTTERDAM April Roughly half of this year s expected hectare Dutch sugar beet crop is already in the ground a spokesman for Suiker Unie the largest sugar processor in the Netherlands told Reuters Conditions are generally good and the average sowing date for the crop is expected to be around April against April last year and a year average of April the spokesman added It is far too early yet to say what kind of output we can expect when it comes to harvest in September but at least the crop is off to a very good start he said Last year the Netherlands planted a record hectares of sugar beet and produced a record mln tonnes of white sugar substantially more than the country s combined A and B quota of tonnes This year however a self imposed quota system has been introduced with the aim of cutting plantings to hectares and reducing white sugar output to around tonnes to minimise the amount of non quota C sugar produced Only farmers with a record of growing suger beet have been allotted quotas This is expected to prevent the area being boosted by dairy or cereal farmers moving into sugar Reuter
