GOULD GLD INTRODUCES NEW MINI SUPERCOMPUTERS CHICAGO March Gould Inc said it is introducing a new generation of very high performance mini supercomputers for intensive engineering applications Called the NPL the mini supercomputers use Gould s UTX operating system which is a compatible multi processor extension of the UNIX operating system consisting of complete AT and T System V and Berkeley BSD environments company officials said at a teleconference The introduction of the NPL family of mini supercomputers is by far Gould s most significant computer line developed to date chairman James McDonald said Patrick Rickard computer systems president said that he expects sales of NPL family computers to account for pct of the division s revenues for the first year after its introduction and increase to pct of revenues in five years Computer operations accounted for one third or about mln dlrs of Gould s total revenues for of mln dlrs a company spokesman said The NP the first series of the new family uses an open systems architecture including parallel and high speed vector processing and massive memory to achieve its supercomputing capability Gould officers said The NP family will form the foundation for new systems which are expected to be brought to market through the s McDonald said The computers are expected to have applications in science and engineering in aerospace and defense and extend into other areas such as medical sciences Rick Baron senior director of marketing development said Gould said it priced and packaged the NP at a cost which will provide the power and advantages of a traditional supercomputer at a fraction of the cost The NP product line includes several models priced from dlrs to mln dlrs Gould officials said adding that the company has already signed orders for eight NP systems The low end NP models will be available in the third quarter and the high end will be available in the first quarter they said According to Gould officials the NP cost mln dlrs to develop and the company plans to spend between to mln to develop the rest of the family line Between now and the company expects to ship two to three billion dlrs of NP mini supercomputers Offering up to mln Whetstone instructions per second and mln floating point operations per second the largest of the new systems Model incorporates up to four billion bytes of physical memory they said The NP family has connectability but not compatability with IBM and Xerox computers a company spokesman said Reuter
