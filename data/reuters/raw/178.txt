SWISS ECONOMY IN EXCELLENT CONDITION OECD SAYS PARIS Feb Switzerland s economy combining low unemployment financial stability and a large external payments surplus is in excellent condition and faces a satisfactory future the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development OECD said This reflected the success of stable and relatively tight fiscal and monetary policies followed by the government it said The OECD in its annual report on Switzerland picked out some signs of a slowdown in activity and a slight pick up in inflation this year but said these gave no cause for concern The study forecast a decline in Gross Domestic Product growth to pct this year from an estimated two pct in and a small rise in consumer price inflation to pct after last year s sharp fall to pct from pct in But it said job creation should continue to absorb a modest increase in the workforce leaving the unemployment rate unchanged at around one pct the lowest in the industrial nation OECD area Assuming an average exchange rate of Swiss francs to the dollar this year against in the second half of the report forecast a pct rise in exports and a pct rise in imports this year after rises of pct and pct respectively in The faster growth of imports compared with exports this year and last reflecting buoyant private consumption meant that the contribution of the foreign payments balance to GDP would shrink in both years But given Switzerland s large external surplus there should be no concern if domestic demand grows faster than GDP Which if only in a small way would contribute to improving international balances the OECD said Real private consumption appeared to have been unusually buoyant last year with a pct growth rate after several years of relative weakness it noted In private consumption was expected to slow somewhat to a pct growth rate but should still outstrip overall GDP it added The outlook for investment in plant and machinery remained bright into and with capacity use at near record levels last year there was scope for rationalisation and modernisation in both the industry and service sectors it said As a consequence growth in machinery and equipment investment is likely to decelerate only slightly this year after vigorous growth in But the report raised a questionmark over the prospects for tourism and the banking industry two major service sector earners of foreign exchange The long term appreciation of the Swiss Franc and the accelerating deregulation of foreign banking markets could lead to a loss of international market share for both it said Particularly for the banks recent developments in international financial markets give rise to the question whether the Swiss financial system which has shown substantial flexibility in the past is adapting itself at the speed required To preserve its competitive position it said REUTER
