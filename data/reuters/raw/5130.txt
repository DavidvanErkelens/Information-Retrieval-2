MEXICO TEMPORARILY HALTS DEBT EQUITY SWAPS By Alan Wheatley Reuters NEW YORK March Mexico has temporarily suspended its debt equity swap program in a move that some bankers see as an attempt to increase pressure on reluctant foreign banks to participate in a new billion dlr loan for the country The scheme which gives foreign firms access to cheap pesos to finance investment in Mexico is likely to resume soon after the loan package is signed on March But the move is a further indication of the strains that have developed between Mexico and the banks because of the difficulty of syndicating the huge loan bankers said Bankers said that Mexico suspended the swap program on February Adolfo Hegewisch Mexico s Undersecretary for Commerce confirmed that the swap program had been halted but he told a Euromoney conference on debt equity swaps that Mexico had been forced to act because it had been inundated with applications Between January and February firms had applied to do a debt equity conversion compared with between May and December We were not accustomed to receive so much work said Hegewisch who is responsible for foreign investment in Mexico Bankers said applications totalling two billion dlrs had piled up at the finance ministry which has said it wants to limit the amount of swaps to mln dlrs a month But some bankers who declined to be identified said the halt also suited Mexico as it would keep up pressure on the banks during the final campaign to persuade all creditors worldwide to participate in the loan Over pct of the loan has been subscribed but dozens of smaller banks are still baulking Assistant U S Treasury Secretary David Mulford said yesterday that the reluctance of these banks had nearly jeopardized the deal at one stage The Mexicans basically said We re not going to subsidize foreigners until we have a deal one banker said Other bankers however said Mexico s motives were not so sinister and that the suspension was mainly due to the absence of top ministry officials in New York for the debt talks They want to focus on the deal and they wanted the banks to focus on the deal one source said Apart from the present disruption bankers and company officials said the Mexican debt equity scheme has been a huge success Frank Fountain Assistant Treasurer at Chrysler Corp said a mln dlr swap it made in December had gone so smoothly that Chrysler has plans for more Chrysler working through Manufacturters Hanover Trust Co bought Mexican public sector debt with a face value of mln dlrs mainly from European banks The cost was about mln dlrs in cash and paper It then presented the paper to Mexico s central bank and received the equivalent of mln dlrs worth of pesos which it invested in its local subsidiary to produce cars for export to North America Susan Segal senior vice president of Manufacturers Hanover said the swaps not only reduce Mexico s debt burden but help to recapitalize local industries that may have been squeezed out of the local capital markets Fountain said that even a large well established firm such as Chrysler had found it difficult to arrange long term peso financing on reasonable terms in Mexico Industrial companies have done most of the swaps to date and Hegewisch said that many of the applications now pending are for investments in the electronic and chemical industries with Japanese and Korean firms showing particular interest But the interest is spreading Segal said Manufacturers Hanover has been authorized to convert part of its own portfolio of loans into equity investment in Mexican hotels She said the sums involved are considerable but gave no details The bank is also looking into joint ventures with manufacturing and trading companies Segal added And as part of the agreement with the banks that will be signed next week Mexican residents will be allowed to participate in the scheme hitherto reserved for foreign firms in the hope that some of the billion dlrs estimated to be held abroad will be repatriated Reuter
