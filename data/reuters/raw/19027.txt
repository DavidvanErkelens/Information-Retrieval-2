FED DATA SUGGEST NO CHANGE IN MONETARY POLICY By Kathleen Hays Reuters NEW YORK June New U S Banking data suggest the Federal Reserve is guiding monetary policy along a steady path and is not signalling any imminent change of course economists said But they also said that if money supply growth remains weak as this week s unexpected eight billion dlr M decline suggests it may this could influence the Fed to loosen its credit reins and move toward a more accommodative monetary policy A Reuter survey of money market economists produced a forecast of a mln dlr M decline for the week ended June with estimates ranging from a gain of one billion dlrs to a decline of four billion Instead M fell eight billion dlrs to billion dlrs at a seasonally adjusted annual rate Coming on the heels of a billion decrease in M for the week ended June this means the nation s money supply has fallen more than billion dlrs in the past two weeks economists said M has hit an air pocket of weakness said Bill Sullivan of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc While M may have lost its significance as an indicator of economic growth Sullivan said Fed officials might be concerned the latest drop in M means another month of sluggish growth in the broader monetary aggregates M and M which are seen as better gauges of economic growth Latest monthly M and M data showed that as of May both measures were growing at rates below the bottom of the Fed s to pct target ranges If money growth does not accelerate Fed officials concerned that this indicates economic growth is flagging could turn toward easier monetary policy economists said Does this mean that the Fed abandons its current open market position No Sullivan said But does this mean the end of tightening for the time being Definitely yes Economists said average adjusted discount window borrowings of mln dlrs for the latest two week bank statement period were lower than they had expected Most believed the Fed had targetted a two week borrowings average of around mln dlrs But they said that if it had not been for a large one day net miss in the Fed s reserve projections the higher borrowings target would probably have been reached A drop in May U S Housing starts and continued weakness in auto sales show key sectors of the U S Economy are lagging while a recent modest pct gain in May producer prices has helped dispel inflation fears Slifer said If this continues we can entertain the notion of Fed easing at some point he said Other economists said the Fed would probably pay little attention to weak money supply growth It has been a number of years since M has given good signs of what s going on in the economy one said I don t think M shows that the economy is falling apart and the Fed should ease Economists agreed a stable dollar will continue to be a prerequisite for any move by the Fed toward easier monetary policy They said the Fed is reluctant to lower short term rates for fear this would spur expectations of a weaker dollar and higher inflation which would push up long term yields and choke off econmomic growth But Sullivan said the dollar has been steady since late April The Fed has to determine if this represents a fundamental change for the dollar If it does then this gives them more room to ease he said REUTER
