COFFEE PRICES SET TO CONTINUE SLIDE TRADERS By Martin Hayes and Jane Merriman Reuters LONDON April Coffee prices look set to continue sliding in the near term given the lack of progress towards a new International Coffee Organization ICO export quota accord according to coffee traders and analysts Robusta coffee futures dipped sharply to year lows yesterday at stg per tonne basis the May position when the lack of new debate on quotas at ICO talks here confirmed expectations that efforts to restore quotas would not be revived at this stage they said The day ICO average composite price fell to cents a lb for April the lowest for years Quotas will not now be renegotiated before the ICO s annual September council session and in the interim the Brazilian frost season from June to August may prove the only bullish factor to stem further price weakness they said Futures bounced back from the lows today towards the previous trading range around stg per tonne on May as the market recovered from yesterday s confidence blip one trader commented But despite today s upturn the overall trend is for lower prices in the near future one trade source said The market had become increasingly vulnerable to yesterday s shakeout having held within a stg second position trading range for successive sessions he said Technically the market is more likely to decline further as it absorbs today s brief rally Steep declines towards the stg area could foster a three figure mentality and speculators may elect to push for coffee prices below the psychological stg level he added Some traders said today s upturn was in part due to Brazil s opening last night of May green coffee export registrations This had been widely anticipated by the market and came as no surprise but it did remove some prevailing uncertainty and light trade buying was seen this morning as a consequence However the overall trend remains downwards and a test of support at stg should be expected soon with the only possible supportive influence on the horizon being the approach of Brazil s frost season they said Roasters are believed to be well covered limiting activities to modest hand to mouth purchases and generally not taking up producer offers they added Central American producers have sold the bulk of their current crops but robusta producers in West Africa and Indonesia need to sell coffee for April through July shipment and this could pressure prices further traders said However one dealer although seeing no reason to be bullish advised caution Everybody s bearish now just as they were bullish when the market was at stg he said Arthur Cherry coffee analyst at E D and F Man expressed doubts the price spiral would continue much below current levels One dlr coffee is catastrophic for many producers there must be a minimum below which prices cannot fall While prices dropped to the lowest levels since September yesterday manufacturers have no plans to cut their retail prices Its impossible to say we can t predict anything like that at this stage a General Foods spokesman said Manufacturers have lowered prices recently anyway in response to market weakness At the beginning of March the price of a gram jar of coffee was cut to stg from stg in Britain But should coffee market prices continue to fall the situation would be reviewed the spokesman added Nestle also has no plans to make additional price cuts in the near future The market seems to have established some equilibrium and doesn t look set to go much lower a Nestle spokesman commented Coffee s plunge this week has been mirrored by tea which fell to a year low at today s auction at stg per kilo for medium quality traders added Reuter
