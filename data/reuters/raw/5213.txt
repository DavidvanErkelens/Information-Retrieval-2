EUROPEAN BEET PLANTINGS SEEN LITTLE CHANGED By Douglas Learmond Reuters LONDON March European sugar beet plantings are expected to show little change from last year despite recent firmness in world prices analysts and industry sources said A Reuter survey of planting intentions showed that while so far European Community EC growers plan unchanged to lower areas increases are expected in some Eastern European nations Trade analysts said their private reports give similar results and do not differ significantly from the first estimate of stagnant European beet plantings made last week by West German sugar statistician F O Licht Areas may be slightly lower but analysts and agricultural experts said the steady rise in yields resulting from improved seed varieties and better farming techniques could offset this In recent years good autumn weather has given yields a late boost making up for lower areas despite some disappointing starts to growing seasons Changes in EC areas reflect the extent to which producers will grow so called C sugar for unsubsidised sale to the world market This is what is produced in excess of the basic area needed to meet the EC A and B quotas which receive full and partial price support respectively Some analysts said the open row that broke out last week between producers and the EC commission over its export policy could have serious implications for future sugar output Beet producers have threatened to effectively dump nearly one mln tonnes of white sugar into EC intervention stocks as they feel export subsidies have been too low to compensate for the gap between high EC internal and low world market prices However with the EC budget stretched to breaking point this could give treasury ministers extra resolve in resisting higher guaranteed sugar prices and build a case for a future cut in the basic A and B quotas they added In France the largest producer of EC quota and non quota sugar the sugar market intervention board FIRS said first planting intentions indicate an area about the same as last year s hectares nine pct below the previous year The basic trend is towards stability a FIRS spokesman said Unlike world market raw sugar prices in dollars white sugar French franc prices are not particularly high and are not encouraging higher planting levels he said Beet sugar output last year was mln tonnes with an average yield of tonnes per ha the highest in the EC apart from the Netherlands but below the previous year and a five year average In West Germany recent price rises have not altered plans since planting decisions were taken a few months ago industry sources said The farm ministry said a December survey is still valid and plantings should be cut slightly after being trimmed by just under four pct in when yields were above average Licht last week estimated West German plantings at a reduced hectares against last year British Sugar Plc the monopoly beet processor has signed up U K Farmers to grow mln tonnes of beet This should yield about mln tonnes of whites Last year s crop equalled the second highest ever at mln tonnes British Sugar has A and B quotas totalling mln tonnes of whites and its C output is due to improved yields from more consistent disease resistant seed types Recent price rises have not altered Polish plans Wincenty Nowicki a deputy director of Cukropol the Amalgamated Sugar Industry Enterprises said World prices are still below Polish production costs and there is no way to convince farmers to increase the area above the already signed contracted level The national plan set before prices began to rise put plantings this year at hectares against in Nowicki said Last year production was mln tonnes World prices have less impact in Italy than in France or Germany as it is traditionally not an exporter but is geared to the domestic market an official at the national beet growers association said Italian sowings are not yet complete but surveys suggest a drop from last year s ha especially in the north where some farmers have switched to soya Beet output last season of mln tonnes yielded a higher than expected mln tonnes of white sugar Dutch plantings are expected to fall to ha from a record in as a new self imposed quota system comes into force a spokesman for Centrale Suiker the second largest Dutch sugar processor said The new system aims for an average of around tonnes of white sugar and to cut output of C sugar Last year the Netherlands produced a record mln tonnes of white sugar against a combined A and B quota of only tonnes The world price of sugar would have to rise much higher than it has done recently to make planned production of C sugar really worthwhile the spokesman said Western agricultural experts in Moscow said Soviet planting intentions are likely to be unchanged Licht put this year s Soviet beet area at mln ha against mln last year Hungary is expanding its beet area to ha from some in the official MTI news agency said but diplomats said policy is to balance supply with domestic demand The Spanish ministry of agriculture said beet sowings are estimated unchanged at ha this year A spokesman for Denmark s largest beet concern De Danske Sukkerfabrikker A S said its sugar target was unchanged from at tonnes from a steady area of ha In Sweden where beet is grown just to meet domestic demand the planted area is seen little changed at ha against last year according to a spokesman for sugar company Svenska Sockerfabriks AB Last year Irish yields were the lowest for years due to late sowings and the state run Irish Sugar Plc said the plantings target is the equivalent of hectares down from in REUTER
