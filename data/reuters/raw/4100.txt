AUSTRALIA EXPECTS RISE IN MEAT EXPORTS TO MIDEAST By Ian MacKenzie Reuters BAHRAIN March Australia expects meat and livestock exports to the Middle East to maintain an upward trend this year managing director of the Australian Meat and Livestock Corp Peter Frawley said He told Reuters an improvement in the economic climate and less competition from the European Community should lead in the Gulf area to higher beef sales which dropped from tonnes in to just tonnes last year In the last three to four months there has been a resurgence of inquiries he said Frawley is on a Gulf tour which will also take him to Saudi Arabia the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait to assess market potential On beef exports he said a pct drop in European Community intervention stock in the past months would help Australian sales The fall meant the EC was not as aggressive in these markets where the Australian trade was the natural source of supply and Australia was now back in Frawley said He said there was a debate in Australia as to whether the Middle East market for livestock which accounts for two thirds of meat export value to the area would be maintained He believed the trade would remain with a continuing demand for fresh meat The number of live sheep shipped last year to Saudi Arabia the biggest single market was compared with in The numbers shipped to the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain fell however Frawley said the slackening in demand in the Gulf had been offset by other Arab countries around the Mediterranean Other than livestock Australia s overall meat sales to the Middle East rose to tonnes in from tonnes the previous year largely due to the sale of tonnes of mutton and lamb to Iran Australia sold tonnes to Iran in after being virtually excluded by New Zealand competition for several years Frawley said the sale contract had included a barter provision but Iran had paid in full in cash Negotiations with the Iranians for shipments were currently under way with Iran again seeking credit and barter provisions he said Frawley said there had been a tremendous growth in demand for chilled lamb in the last four to five years and he predicted this would continue The Middle East and the Gulf in particular is now Australia s largest market for lamb chilled and flown in Australia is in an ideal position to provide the supplies if the market is willing to pay a premium for a fresh young product he said REUTER
