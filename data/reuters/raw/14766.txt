CURRENCY FUTURES TO KEY OFF G G MEETINGS by Brad Schade Reuters CHICAGO April News of an agreement among G and G finance ministers meeting in Washington this week will be key to the direction of currency futures at the International Monetary Market but any such agreement will need to go beyond the Paris accord to stem the recent rise in futures financial analysts said If they the finance ministers give the market something really new to look at that is some package that goes beyond the Paris agreement you could have a real boost in the dollar said Shearson Lehman Brothers analyst Anne Mills On the other hand anything neutral would tend to be bearish for the dollar Mills said Traders and analysts agree a simple reaffirmation of the Paris accord will not be enough to halt the decline in the dollar nor will central bank intervention A lot of people are looking for a reason to buy currencies and sell the dollar said one trader for a large retail firm on the floor of the IMM If there is no concrete resolution they will be looking to sell the dollar possibly down to the mark level he said Technically most currency futures are poised for another rise said Smith Barney Harris Upham analyst Craig Sloane Sloane noted that June yen futures set a new contract high on Tuesday and closed at its best level ever while June sterling set a new contract high on Monday Everything seems to be coming to a head right now and you don t need much to get things rolling Sloane said In particular the June Canadian dollar for which Sloane recently put out a buy recommendation has hovered in a range between and in recent weeks forming a triangle on the charts from which it may soon break out on the upside A close above the contract high of would signal a breakout Sloane said and would likely mean the nearby Canadian dollar contract would extend its advance to near the level June Canadian dollar closed at Tuesday Mills noted however that interest rate differentials between Canadian securities and U S securities have narrowed dramatically recently with yields on year Canadian bonds only about basis points above U S year notes What has helped the Canadian currency she noted is an increasing proportion of foreign funds flowing into the Canadian equity market particularly from Japanese investors Other analysts however said currency futures may be near the top of their long term rally Something will be done at the G and G meeting to calm people said David Horner of Merrill Lynch Economics The Paris accord has pretty much fixed where major European currencies will trade Horner said But sterling futures may still make another run for new highs up to to dlr in the June contract on the positive atmosphere that will prevail before British elections and possibly another interest rate cut Horner said The June British pound closed at on Tuesday Horner said that new boundaries for the trading range of the yen are likely to come out of the G and G meetings The most likely range will be a bottom for the dollar between to yen per dollar and a top near to yen Horner said In yen futures the bottom of the dollar s range would be equivalent to to in the June contract June yen closed at on Tuesday If such a range does emerge from the meetings we will have one more rally in the yen Horner said Reuter
