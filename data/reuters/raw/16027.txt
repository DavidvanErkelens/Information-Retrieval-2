SEMICONDUCTOR BOOK TO BILL RATIO AT PCT CUPERTINO Calif April The Semiconductor Industry Association put the three month average book to bill ratio at which was above analysts expectations and reflects the sixth straight increase in this indicator of computer industry activity Average booking in the three month period ended in March totaled mln dlrs up pct from a month ago and the highest bookings since September March billings or computer chip sales in the month totaled mln dlrs up pct from a month ago the association said The three month average billings totaled mln dlrs up pct March billings were the strongest recorded since November the association said The book to bill ratio at was the highest since May it noted Preliminary total solid state shipments for the first quarter of totaled billion dlrs up pct from last quarter and up pct from last year s first quarter Semiconductor Industry Association President Andrew Procassini said the rise in the book to bill was due to a substantial increase in U S bookings during March We believe that the bookings increase reflects growing confidence by electronic equipment manufacturers that some end equipment market segments have improved substantially during the first quarter Procassini said in a statement The association also revised its book to bill ratio estimate for the three months ended in February to from earlier It further revised the January book to bill figure to from estimated earlier The three month average book to bill ratio of for March means for every dlrs worth of product shipped computer chip maker received dlrs in new orders Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc analyst Michael Gumport said association numbers indicate March orders were up pct above the normal seasonal level The association does not break out March orders from its three month average which it put at mln dlrs Gumport noted the three month average bookings were well above the mln dlrs anticipated by the industry He said semiconductor stock could rise five to ten pct on the stock market open tomorrow due to the positive numbers Skeptics are going to have to have some pretty strong reasons not to like this group of stocks Gumport said Kidder Peabody and Co analyst Michael Kubiak said the ratio indicates March orders at about one billion dlrs which would be the highest monthly order rate since April He predicted at least a five pct rise in semiconductor stocks on the open and said the stock group could soar as high as pct during the session One month does not a boom time make but this is very good news he said Kubiak attributed the stong semiconductor orders to strength in the personal computer market inventory restocking and strong buying by distributors Purchasing managers had been keeping computer chip inventories low due to the overcapacity in the industry and the slow growth of the economy in general analysts noted The semiconductor industry has been in a slump for the past three years The analysts said the March order and sales numbers are the strongest evidence yet that the trend may be turning Nevertheless they do not expect the Administration to retreat from proposed sanctions against Japanese chip makers They added however if the industry continues to improve it could mean the sanctions will be short term Jack Beedle President of In Stat an electronics industry research firm called the March numbers excellent but also cautioned against excessive optimism I still believe caution should be the word rather than euphoria said Beedle adding that he has yet to see strong indications from the general economy or the computer industry that support a solid long term recovery Beedle said while he thinks the semiconductor industry will have a very good second quarter he still thinks positive shifts in exports and industrial production are needed to sustain a recovery Reuter
