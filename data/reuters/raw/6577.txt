DOE SECRETARY FAVORS HIGHER SPR FILL RATE WASHINGTON March Energy Secretary John Herrington said he believes the Reagan Administration will review its decision to cut the fill rate of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve because of a department report issued yesterday warning of growing U S dependence on oil imports As part of this study I think the Administration will take the fill rate under review Herrington said at a House Energy subcommittee hearing The Administration has proposed cutting the fill rate from barrels of oil per day to bpd in fiscal year to save money My personal feeling is that is too low I favor the maximum fill rate of bpd Herrington said Reuter
