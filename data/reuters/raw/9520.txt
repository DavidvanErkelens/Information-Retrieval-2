ARGENTINE SOYBEAN YIELD ESTIMATES DOWN FURTHER By Manuel Villanueva Reuters BUENOS AIRES March Argentine grain producers again reduced their estimates for the total yield of the soybean crop which will begin to be harvested in mid April trade sources said They said growers now forecast soybean production this season at between and mln tonnes down from last week s estimate of to eight mln tonnes and the to mln tonnes forecast in mid February The new forecast is still higher than last season s record total production Private sources put production at a record to mln tonnes to pct lower than the new forecast for the current crop The official figure for is mln tonnes to pct below this season s new estimates Growers in the past week discovered more empty soybean pods in the main producing areas of southern Cordoba and Santa Fe provinces and northern Buenos Aires The crop since January has been hit by high temperatures and inadequate rainfall Growers fear they may find more empty pods and have to further reduce their forecasts of total yield The area sown to soybeans this season was a record to mln hectares to pct higher than the record of mln hectares The state of the crop continued to be good in general until last week but intense heavy rains since could have caused damage in areas where rainfall was higher than mm Where the rains were less heavy they were considered beneficial although too late to improve yield estimates The rains also benefitted maize and sorghum crops in southern Buenos Aires province but are not expected to influence production forecasts In other areas especially western Buenos Aires where rainfall was more than mm parts of the sunflower maize and sorghum crops not yet harvested may have been damaged The coarse grain crop harvest was interrupted last week by rains which also reached over mm in parts of Cordoba La Pampa and Santa Fe and almost mm in parts of Entre Rios The area sown with maize this season was between and mln hectares two to seven pct less than the mln hectares in The yield of maize continued to be forecast at between and mln tonnes This estimate is to pct lower than the to mln tonnes at which private sources put production and to pct lower than the official mln tonnes The sunflowerseed harvest has covered to pct of the area sown and continues in parts of central Buenos Aires although at a standstill elsewhere due to rain and floods A resumption of full harvesting and assessment of damage is impossible until rains stop and a spell of a week to days of sunshine dries the fields The area sown this season was to mln hectares down to pct on last year s record mln hectares Sunflowerseed production is still forecast at to mln tonnes to pct below the record of mln tonnes The grain sorghum harvest was the least affected by the rains advancing steadily in Santa Fe and Cordoba and starting in La Pampa to cover to pct of the total area sown The area sown was to mln hectares to pct less than the mln hectares the previous season Yield estimates remained at to mln tonnes to pct down on production of to mln tonnes Reuter
