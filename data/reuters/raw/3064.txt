OECD TRADE GROWTH SEEN SLOWING IN LONDON March The nations of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development OECD hampered by sluggish industrial output and trade face slower economic growth and their joint balance of payments will swing into deficit in the Economist Intelligence Unit EIU said The EIU said in its World Trade Forecast it revised OECD economic growth downwards to pct this year compared with a pct growth forecast in December It said the new areas of weakness are West Germany and the smaller European countries it influences and Japan hardest hit by currency appreciation this year The independent research organisation cut its growth rate forecasts for West Germany to pct from pct in December and to pct from three pct for Japan It said it expected the OECD to post a current account deficit of some billion dlrs in both and due in large part to a dlrs a barrel rise in oil prices It said the U S Current account deficit looked likely to fall even more slowly than forecast to billion dlrs in and billion in from billion in It said it expected West Germany to post a billion dlr payments surplus and Japan a billion dlr surplus this year The EIU said it saw oil prices dropping to around dlrs a barrel by end and dlrs in from about dlrs last year as adherence to OPEC output policy becomes increasingly ragged It said the dollar is poised to resume its decline in foreign exchange markets and will lose a further pct on its trade weighted index this year and five pct in after last year s pct drop The average mark dollar rate is put at marks this year and in while the yen dollar rate is expected to break through the yen barrier with an average value of yen in and yen in it said This is not a crash scenario but the dollar s steeper angle of descent increases the risk of ending with a fireball rather than a three point landing the EIU said Talking will not stop the dollar s slide for long and the February meeting of finance ministers of the Group of Five and Canada produced scant promise of either a decisive shift to more expansive policies in West Germany and Japan or a tighter U S Fiscal policy it said It said the key to the dollar s fortunes was the willingness of Japanese institutions to buy U S Government assets despite prospects of sustaining a currency loss Thus far they have been willing the EIC said adding that if Japan was deterred from buying U S Bonds the dollar would collapse To contain such a currency crisis dollar interest rates would have to soar bringing recession and a Third World debt crisis it said On trade the EIU said prospects for look increasingly sick Import growth forecast in December at pct is now seen slowing down to around pct in with a recovery only to pct in it said The weakness of the West German economy is the biggest single factor with import growth there expected to feature a sluggish pct growth in against the pct forecast in December the EIU said On the export side it said it saw weak demand in West Germany affecting export prospects elsewhere in Europe while Japan s exports in would remain flat and sales by U S Exporters would respond only marginally to a lower more competitively priced dollar It said in most of Europe and in Japan raw materials and oil will cost less in domestic currency in than in However rates of inflation will edge up in to over the current OECD average of three pct Non oil commodity prices will show a modest dollar price increase in for the first time since the EIU said After a rise of pct in the dollar price of internationally traded manufactures will go up by pct in and by five pct in it said It said OECD industrial production would rise by only pct in after a weak pct increase in Reuter
