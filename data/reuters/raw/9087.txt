GENCORP GY FIXES RIGHTS SEPARATION DATE AKRON Ohio March Gencorp Inc said that because it is continuing to evaluate General Acquisition Inc s tender offer it has fixed April subject to further extension as the date the rights to purchase preferred shares will trade separately from the common stock as a result of the tender offer This extension of the expiration date is conditioned on no person acquiring beneficial ownership of pct or more of Gencorp s common stock prior to April it said Gencorp said it could distribute the rights certificates to shareholders to days after the March acquisition offer was made However rather than leaving the expiration date in a range the board decided to set April as the day it will distribute the preferred share purchase rights Reuter
