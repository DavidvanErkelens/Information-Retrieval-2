VEGETABLE OILS MAY TIGHTEN DESPITE SEED SURPLUS EDMONTON Alberta March Lower production of coconut and palm oils could lead to a decline in vegetable oil stocks this year despite growing supplies of oilseeds senior oilseeds analyst for Merrill Lynch Capital Markets Mario Balletto said Balletto told a conference of Canadian farmers at Alberta Agriculture s annual farm outlook conference that the world vegetable oil situation is one of potentially tight supplies Prices for edible oils appear to have more upside potential reflecting strong world demand and an unprecedented decline in the production of tree oils Balletto said Balletto estimated production of palm coconut and palm kernel oils this year at mln tonnes down from mln tonnes last year enough to offset higher oilseed output He estimated total vegetable oil production this year at mln tonnes up from mln last year and disappearance at mln tonnes up from mln Unless oilseed crushing increases sharply he said disappearance of vegetable oils could exceed production by tonnes the largest deficit since If world protein meal demand stagnates thus limiting the crush of soybeans the need for serious supply rationing in the edible oils sector could develop he said This would be relatively favorable for the prices of high oil yielding seeds Balletto said Oilseeds on the other hand remain at depressed prices because of burdensome supplies he said World ending stocks of oilseeds are estimated to increase for the fourth straight year to a record mln tonnes compared with mln last year The increase should result from lower disappearance as production is expected to fall to mln tonnes from mln last year he said World soybean production in totalled a record mln tonnes up from mln the previous year Balletto said while production of other oilseeds was lower Higher soybean production in South America and Europe made up for lower production in the United States he said Soybeans account for the bulk of the surplus and U S stocks make up most of those Balletto said The Commodity Credit Corporation owned mln tonnes about half of the world soybean surplus he said Since he said world oilseed stocks have increased mln tonnes During the same period U S soybean stocks increased mln tonnes becoming the dumping ground of the entire world surplus courtesy of the CCC and highlighting the artificially high prices caused by the U S loan program Soybean prices and to a great extent world oilseeds prices are likely to be dominated by the loan program as long as the U S soybean surplus continues For the crop he said prices are likely to hover in a range tied to the U S loan program Upside potential for prices is limited by the huge supply overhang while strong underlying support is provided by the U S loan rate The problem is likely to become worse as the artificially high prices encourage producers in South America Canada and Australia to shift from grains to oilseeds Balletto said Reuter
