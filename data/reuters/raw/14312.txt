MORE U S GRAIN CERTIFICATES NEEDED STUDY SAYS WASHINGTON April More generic grain certificates should be released onto the market in order for the U S certificate program to have its full effect on commodities according to a study by Sparks Commodities Inc The Agriculture Department should make grain deficiency payments and paid land diversion payments in a two third certificate one third cash ratio through fiscal year Carroll Brunthaver president of Sparks Commodities told a House agriculture subcommittee hearing on certificates Thereafter government payments should be issued in roughly a split between cash and certificates Brunthaver said The Sparks study on certificates examined two possible scenarios through the growing season a zero certificate case where no certificate program was assumed and an alternative case labeled adequate certificate case in which sufficient certificates would be released so that grain prices would not be artificially supported by market shortages due to acreage reduction programs or government holdings The study showed that total grain use under the adequate certificate scenario would exceed the zero certificate scenario by pct Usage would be markedly more in and when grain usage under a certificate program was estimated to exceed the zero certificate case by to pct For the five year period examined government expenditures under the adequate certificate case were billion dlrs or pct less than under the zero certificate case The Sparks study said that billion dlrs or pct of those savings resulted from smaller government storage costs The study also estimated that government grain stocks under the adequate certificate case would be billion bushels below the zero certificate case at the end of the period examined The Sparks study said that while certificates permit market prices to fall below loan levels these lower prices increase commodity usage and reduce the net costs of certificates versus cash Reuter
