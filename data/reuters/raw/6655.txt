ENERGY DRILLING INDUSTRY BY JULIE VORMAN Reuters HOUSTON March The drastic cutbacks in U S drilling last year are rapidly deflating the United State s natural gas bubble which could bring spot shortages in gas supplies next winter and a modest recovery in the oilpatch industry analysts said Faltering deliverability of natural gas a commodity that is difficult and costly to import in large quantities could more than double the current U S rig count to near by some analysts said The need to lock in future supplies of gas for utilities and big industrial customers may also bring a resurgence of activity in the Gulf of Mexico s offshore waters where some of the nation s largest gas reserves are located We think an upturn in U S drilling is imminent said James Crandall an analyst with Salomon Brothers Inc Many companies appear to be switching from oil to gas drilling because they re betting that the gas market will be back in balance in a year or two The prospect of diminishing gas supplies is welcome news for drilling and oilfield service companies that barely survived last year s plunge in oil prices from about dlrs a barrel to less than half that Today s relatively stable oil prices of about dlrs a barrel are not enough to spur a return to the heady days of when the U S drilling rig count soared to a record high of more than and oilfield roustabouts commanded premium wages The latest weekly Hughes Tool Co HT rig count a barometer of the oil industry s health showed U S rigs active in what is traditionally the slowest time of the year In the Hughes rig count began the year at but dived to a post World War II low of in July as world oil prices experienced the sharpest decline in recent times Ike Kerridge a Hughes economist said In the United States replaced only about pct of the gas it used and that replacement rate won t be any better this year He added We don t have the options we do with oil Imports of gas from Canada are limited by pipeline capacity and importing liquefied natural gas on ships will not be feasible in the next years because of the cost Only about trillion cubic feet of additional gas reserves were discovered last year while U S consumption approached trillion cubic feet according to industry estimates George Gaspar an oil analyst with Robert W Baird and Co agreed that the need for gas supplies would set the stage for a new cycle of gradual increases in U S drilling We anticipate that natural gas pipelines will need to dedicate to their systems new gas reserves for and supplies That means new drilling programs must begin no later than mid Gaspar said Gasper said he sees a new drilling cycle emerging that could last until and that he expects the average rig count to peak near in December of Much of the search for new gas reserves is likely to be conducted in the offshore waters of the Gulf of Mexico where federal leases on unexplored areas will revert back to the government unless drilling begins in the next two or three years Some of the industry s biggest companies such as Exxon Corp XON Mobil Corp MOB and Union Texas Petroleum have already indicated plans to increase spending for drilling later this year in the Gulf of Mexico Crandall said For example Conoco Inc a Dupont DD subsidiary will spend mln dlrs to build the Gulf of Mexico s deepest production platform which will produce mln cubic feet of gas per day But T Boone Pickens who has acquired huge Texas and Kansas gas reserves for his Mesa Limited Partnership MLP in recent months is not convinced that the drilling industry is on the verge of a recovery Pickens predicts the U S rig count will soon drop below and will not increase significantly until oil prices do The rigs won t go back to work until the price of oil gets above dlrs a barrel said Pickens adding he did not expect to see the rig count top again in his lifetime Tenneco Inc TGT one of the largest U S gas producers is skeptical that a need for additional gas drilling exists Tenneco vice president Joe Foster said he did not expect significant increases in drilling for gas until the early s when the U S gas reserves life will have declined to about seven years supply Current spot market prices of about dlrs per thousand cubic feet will need to rise to about three dlrs to spur reserve replacement he said Reuter
