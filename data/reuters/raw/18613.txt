BUDGET PACT CUTS U S FARM FUNDS BILLION DLRS WASHINGTON June U S House and Senate budget negotiators agreed as part of an overall budget accord reached yesterday to cut billion dlrs from fiscal spending on agricultural programs Congressional sources told Reuters The agreed cut in farm programs is a compromise between billion sought by the Senate and one billion by the House The negotiators also agreed to cut billion from the farm budget in fiscal and billion in for a total of billion in saving over three years sources said The agreement presents the House and Senate Agriculture committees with difficult choices on how to make changes in agriculture programs that achieve the budget savings targets without jeopardizing popular support payments senior Congressional aides told Reuters Some farm state lawmakers already are manuevering to find the budget savings Rep Dan Glickman D Kan Chairman of the House grains subcommittee has introduced a bill which would freeze wheat and corn loan rates for the crop at the current dlrs and dlrs respectively saying it would save mln dlrs House Agriculture Committee chairman Kika De la Garza has said the committee will consider the Glickman proposal But Congressional sources said the proposal is unlikely to be approved because of opposition from Republican lawmakers and a strong stance by Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng who said freezing loan rates would send the wrong signal to other major grain export competitors and would not achieve the budget savings Glickman claims Another area where Glickman and other have said budget savings might be made is to increase acreage reduction program ARP levels for wheat and corn However on this issue also Lyng has taken a strong stand within the Reagan administration arguing that the crop wheat acreage reduction should be left at pct and not pct as sought by the Office of Management and Budget OMB Most commodity lobbyists expect Lyng to prevail Congressional sources said the only way to achieve significant budget cuts through ARP increases would be to boost the corn ARP But one informed Congressional source said singling out corn for an ARP increase would would be seen as unfair to one commodity Congressional sources said the areas where Congress is most likely to eventually look for budget savings are some tightening of the payment limitation rules and possible adoption of a program for the crops of major grains Those changes would achieve a portion of the billion but not enough they said Ultimately Congressional sources said the agriculture committees may be forced to apply an across the board cut on all Commodity Credit Corp payments to farmers including price support loans and deficiency payments similar to the Gramm Rudman Hollings budget cut applied in fiscal This idea has been suggested by the American Farm Bureau Federation AFBF as the fairest approach for all commodities Reuter
