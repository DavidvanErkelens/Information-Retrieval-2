GERMAN CAR FIRMS SEEN PRODUCING SOLID RESULTS By Anthony Williams Reuters BONN June The West German car industry celebrated its th birthday with a record breaking performance at home and is due to turn in another set of solid results in But share market analysts warn it faces continued problems from the strong German mark and predict increasingly aggressive competition in Europe from the Japanese On the plus side for the industry which is West Germany s biggest foreign exchange earner the analysts are confident the technical superiority and innovative qualities of the luxury producers will help them maintain a strong market profile Most analysts thought Daimler Benz AG DAIG F would do best this year but expected Dr Ing H C F Porsche AG PSHG F to continue its slide because of the weak U S Dollar They were generally optimistic for Bayerische Motoren Werke AG BMWG F BMW but some were sceptical it could match record profits Views were mixed on Volkswagen AG VOWG F but some analysts took comfort from the fact that Europe s leading car maker had apparently put a major currency scandal behind it VW could be vulnerable as Japanese exporters suffering from the strength of the yen against the dollar switched their sales offensive from the U S To Europe they said Analyst Joseph Rooney with brokers James Capel in London noted the Japanese drive was coming at a time when the whole European market was expected to contract slightly But analysts saw most German manufacturers meeting the challenge even though the Japanese were now starting to focus on the up market sector BMW s chairman Eberhard von Kuenheim shrugged off the Japanese drive in an interview with Wirtschaftswoche magazine I view the move by the Japanese into the top class with a certain equanimity Not only are we playing on home turf we also have technical superiority he said The car industry benefitted last year from clarification of domestic rules on low pollution cars which meant orders put off in were carried out the following year Tax cuts generally boosted domestic demand especially for cars Domestic registrations leapt by nearly pct to a record mln cars The VDA industry association says this might ease to mln in but predicts another good year Looking to the future Daimler has designated billion marks for car sector spending in the next five years Chairman Werner Breitschwerdt says spending is not aimed at quantity but improving high quality technology and accessories Analyst Stephen Reitman with Phillips and Drew in London said Daimler had the best earnings profile of West German producers with group profits per share rising to marks from in Analysts were more cautious about VW Reinhard Fischer with Bank in Liechtenstein BiL in Frankfurt saw VW s group earnings per share falling to marks in from in A recent report from his bank said last year s currency losses were a sign of mismanagement It stressed heavy losses from VW s Brazilian operations and its Spanish unit SEAT VW s first quarter figures also highlighted problems in both the U S And Brazil analysts said VW reported flat first quarter earnings except for a pct fall in U S Sales and Brazilian sales which dived pct Reitman was more optimistic than BiL about VW s group earnings and predicting an improvement in both Spain and Brazil he saw an unchanged marks per share He also said that VW now stood to benefit from not hedging against foreign exchange fluctuations In a May study he wrote One point in VW s favour is that its extraordinary policy of not hedging forward has meant that it will have less far to go in adjusting to current DM Dollar rates than the other German manufacturers who were to a lesser or greater extent protected up to Reitman was also reassured by the apparent end of the currency scandal where allegedly faked forward contracts were not acknowledged by VW s banks VW fixed final losses from the fraud at mln marks for which provisions were made in VW s new Audi a sporty model which German media reports say was designed to jazz up Audi s staid Grandpa image contributed significantly to VW s first quarter performance The doubled its sales against the year ago level But the Audi range as a whole has suffered a huge setback in the U S Because of an image problem linked to claims of unintentional acceleration Von Kuenheim won t be pinned down on BMW s profits but at a news conference he emphasised earnings were a record high Without referring to he added If profits are less in one year or the other they will still be good Rooney said group profits per share which BMW does not publish would rise to marks this year Some analysts put the group profit at marks a figure BMW does not deny But Reitman was more pessimistic predicting marks per share in and a return to next year He said BMW will be the story of when it plans to launch an updated version of its Five series BMW also has a big investment programme under way and Bil s Fischer said depreciations could affect earnings Other analysts pointed to possible hedging problems and Reitman noted a marks to the dollar hedge expired this September Reitman said the outlook for Porsche was bearish for the year to end July Porsche s group profits at marks per share fell pct from the record marks in and Reitman saw marks in With the U S Currently accounting for pct of unit sales this is expected to fall to pct in the full year Porsche s earnings remain uncomfortably exposed to the DM dollar relationship he said REUTER
