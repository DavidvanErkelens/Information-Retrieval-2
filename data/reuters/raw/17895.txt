CENTRAL BANK HEAD SAYS PHILIPPINE GROWTH ON TARGET By Chaitanya Kalbag Reuters MANILA June The Philippines first quarter growth figures released yesterday indicated the government was likely to achieve its targets Central Bank governor Jose Fernandez said in an interview The National Economic Development Authority NEDA announced yesterday gross domestic product GDP grew pct and gross national product GNP pct in the first quarter from a year earlier I don t see anything on the horizon that should cut it growth short Fernandez said NEDA said GNP had grown pct and GDP pct in the fourth quarter of from a year earlier Last year s GNP growth put earlier at pct was revised to pct Certainly I do not see any shortage in external resources and if GNP growth continues at this level I would assume that domestic resources on the fiscal side would be generated and would not be a stumbling block Fernandez said I think even before the figures came out simply looking at key indicators such as consumption of fuel oil and power showed that the economy was on a different track from last year he said Fernandez said consumption tended to be heavier in the first and second quarters because of the dry weather and it could drop off in the third quarter He said the most significant sign of recovery lay in the manufacturing sector which grew by pct after declines in and a slow turnaround in the second half of That is not a seasonal thing it is secular he said He said the government had met all monetary targets set for the first quarter in consultation with the International Monetary Fund IMF It expected to draw down the fourth tranche from its mln SDR stand by arrangement soon The Philippines has so far drawn three tranches totalling mln SDRs from the arrangement expiring on April Fernandez said an IMF mission would visit here in July or August to review performance in the January June period He said IMF repayments were projected to total billion dlrs over the period and drawings only mln dlrs Repayments were inevitable and many countries would find their net repayments to the IMF rising in the next few years It means that since there will be a net drain on ODA official development assistance accounts the commercial banking system will be requested to hold the line he said It is an internal constraint that exists because the IMF debt cannot be rescheduled Fernandez said The Philippines rescheduled billion dlrs of its billion dlr foreign commercial debt in March Fernandez said Central Bank bills introduced in March to mop up excess liquidity had peaked at billion pesos in April But their unwinding on maturity dates started in October last year had almost been completed He said auctions of treasury bills whose outstanding level touched billion pesos on May were going well Treasury bills will remain a basic monetary tool he said Commenting on the country s foreign debt Fernandez said I think the Philippine debt stock looms large because our own receipts from exports have not taken the same kind of leap forward as might have been suitable The foreign debt is projected by the Central Bank to reach billion dlrs by the end of NEDA said exports totalled billion dlrs in the first quarter while imports were billion dlrs Fernandez said the government had targeted GNP growth of between six and pct this year He cautioned that while growth so far was high the targets had not yet been achieved Fernandez said he saw no merit in arguments by some economists that the peso currently pegged at to the dollar ought to be devalued to make the country s exports more competitive By being pegged to the dollar on a basket basis the peso has already substantially devalued against all of the country s trading partners he said On the proposed Omnibus Investment Code he said he was opposed to a clause which would allow the unrestricted repatriation abroad of investments made during the first two years after the imposition of the Code The imposition of the Code scheduled for last January has been delayed by objections from some business groups I think any central bank certainly this one after the events of the past two or two and a half years has to be prudent This is not the time to throw all caution to the winds and I m not about to do that Fernandez said It would be ideal if we reach a point where movement of capital and earnings can be free he said We have had one year of reasonably good results Certainly we continue to have a fairly heavy drain on our external availabilities simply by servicing our debts REUTER
