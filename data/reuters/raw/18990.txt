JAPAN TRADE SURPLUS WILL GROW AGAIN IN OECD PARIS June Japan s trade surplus is likely to continue to grow in as sales of Japanese goods abroad increase while domestic demand remains sluggish the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development OECD said In its latest half yearly review of the world economy the OECD said Japan managed to considerably reduce its surplus last year when domestic demand grew by four pct in while export markets rose by only two pct But it said this differential between the growth of domestic and foreign demand would reverse in and thus weakening the international adjustment process It forecast a slowing in domestic growth to little over two pct but with a rise in exports of pct in and pct in As a result the current account surplus in will rise to billion dlrs from billion in although in it should fall back to billion dlrs The OECD outlook did not take account of the billion yen package announced last month to stimulate domestic demand and increase imports to Japan However OECD officials said the measures will significantly strengthen domestic demand quite possibly exceeding one pct GNP when the full effects have worked through and thus will provide some stimulus to imports The OECD outlook said Continued large current account surpluses and the further build up of an already substantial net external asset position could well lead to upward pressure on the yen It said that further appreciation could then lead manufacturers to postpone their investment plans and thus weaken domestic growth The OECD said Japan s Gross National Product was likely to gorw an annual two pct in and below s pct growth But it said Japan would continue its good performance on inflation with a zero figure expected in compared to a pct rise in consumer prices last year Reuter
