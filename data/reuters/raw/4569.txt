SEC ASKS NYSE TO TIGHTEN TRIPLE WITCHING PROCESS WASHINGTON March The Securities and Exchange Commission asked the New York Stock Exchange to tighten an experimental procedure used in the past six months to dampen volatility linked to the so called triple witching hour The Big Board has been collecting and publicizing information on large imbalances of market on close MOC orders placed on major stocks one half hour before closing on so called expiration Fridays in September and December Expiration Fridays or triple witching hours occur every three months when stock options stock index options and futures on index options expire simultaneously As aribrageurs liquidated their futures and options on previous expiration Fridays they sold huge amounts of stock which they had used to offset their positions The huge sell orders which usually entered the market in the final frantic minutes on expiration Fridays triggered wild price swings in the stocks which serve as the basis for the options and futures The gyrations prompted the SEC last September to request that the Big Board ask its members submit all MOCs by hrs on expiration Fridays which would then be made public giving the market a half hour to settle order imbalances But in a March letter to NYSE President Robert Birnbaum SEC Director of Market Regulation cited problems in the experimental procedure during the Dec expiration Friday A large number of MOC buy orders were not placed until after EST on Dec which helped send the Dow Jones Industrial Average up points in the final minutes of the day to a point gain on the day Ketchum said Citing the SEC s concern about such trading Ketchum asked the exchange to tighten its procedure by not accepting any pre existing MOC orders after if they could have been placed earlier The new restriction which SEC officials said merely clarifies the terms of the existing experimental procedure would bar the liquidation of stocks through MOC orders for arbitrage purposes after hrs even if they offset other reported order imbalances in those stocks The only MOC orders the SEC will allow to be placed after EST on March the next expiration Friday are those that are received by Big Board member firms after EST and which help reduce existing order imbalances Ketchum said If there are no published imbalances in a particular stock no MOC orders will be accepted in that stock he said If dissemination of MOC orders is to provide an accurate indication of true order imbalances then all existing MOC orders must be submitted by p m and only those new MOC orders responding to reported imbalances can be permitted Ketchum said The letter did not say how the SEC or the NYSE would determine the difference between pre existing MOC orders that would be barred and new MOC orders that would be allowed to reduce imbalances But an SEC official said the agency hopes the NYSE and its members would adhere to the rules in a spirit of cooperation REUTER
