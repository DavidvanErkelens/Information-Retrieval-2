U S CORN ACREAGE SEEN NEAR RECORD LOW by Maggie McNeil Reuters WASHINGTON March U S corn acreage this year is likely to drop to the lowest level since the unsurpassed acreage reductions of the PIK year and could rank as one of the lowest corn plantings in the United States in sixty years Agriculture Department officials said USDA releases its official plantings report on March Agriculture Department analysts said next week s figures will likely show a sharp drop in acreage to as low as mln acres down pct from last year s plantings of mln acres Assuming an mln acre drop in plantings U S corn production will also decrease significantly Analysts said corn production could drop by over one billion bushels to around seven billion bushels Expected signup of up to pct in the feed grains program along with mln acres enrolled in the conservation program will cause acreage to plummet Department feedgrain analysts said There s no question that there will be a sharp decrease in corn acreage one said It s difficult for any farmer to not go along with the program this year Soybean acreage is also expected to decline this year but at a much slower rate of around four pct USDA analysts said Soybean plantings could drop to mln acres or below they said compared to last year s level of mln acres If analysts unofficial estimates prove correct then the drop in u s corn acreage will be the largest since when farmers idled mln acres in the Payment In Kind program Farmers planted only around mln acres of corn in A severe drought that summer in major producing states caused yields to tumble and final crop production to total only billion bushels Given normal weather conditions this year USDA analysts said the corn crop could end up around seven billion bushels down from last year s crop of billion bushels This kind of acreage reduction will mean a significant reduction in production an analyst said A crop of seven billion bushels is close to the annual U S corn usage so surplus stocks while not decreasing would not increase significantly a specialist said High producing corn belt states are expected to show the greatest acreage reductions based upon historical participation in government programs analysts said In contrast soybean acreage is likely to be cut the most in marginal producing areas of the southeast and the western corn belt a USDA soybean analyst said Soybean acreage in the eastern corn belt will not budge he said Neither does he expect any significant acreage cuts in higher producing delta areas Soybean production could drop fractionally from last year s billion bushels to to billion he said U S soybean acreage after soaring to mln acres in from only mln acres five years prior to that has steadily declined in the s U S corn acreage with the exception of has been in the low to mid mln acre range for the past years The highest corn plantings reported in the years that USDA has kept such records was in when farmers planted mln acres and obtained average yields of bushels per acre Last year U S farmers obtained record corn yields averaging bushels per acre We have absolutely no trouble producing an eight billion bushel crop on only mln acres or so an analyst said Corn acreage will probably level at around mln acres as long as government program provisions remain the same analysts said Currently farmers enrolling in the program are required to set aside pct of their base acreage and then are eligible for payments of two dlrs per bushel by idling an additional pct of their acreage To get to the PIK level of mln acres we would have to provide more incentives an analyst said Reuter
