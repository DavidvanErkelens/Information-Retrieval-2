U S SUGAR PROGRAM CUT SENT TO CONGRESS BY USDA WASHINGTON MARCH The U S Agriculture Department formally transmitted to Congress a long awaited proposal to drastically slash the sugar loan rate and compensate growers for the cut with targeted income payments In a letter to the Congressional leadership accompanying the Sugar Program Improvements Act of Peter Myers Deputy Agriculture Secretary said the Reagan administration wants the sugar loan rate cut to cents per pound beginning with the crop down from cts now Sugarcane and beet growers would be compensated by the government for the price support cut with targeted income payments over the four years to The payments would cost an estimated billion dlrs Myers said The administration sugar proposal is expected to be introduced in the House of Representatives next week by Rep John Porter R Ill Congressional sources said the program cut is so drastic it is unlikely to be adopted in either the House or Senate because politically influential sugar and corn growers and high fructose corn syrup producers will strongly resist The direct payment plan outlined by the administration targets subsidies to small cane and beet growers and gradually lowers payments over four years It also excludes from payment any output exceeding short tons raw sugar per grower For example on the first tons of production a grower would receive cts per lb in fiscal cts in cts in and cts in The income payments would be based on the amount of commercially recoverable sugar produced by a farmer in the or crop years whichever is less USDA said Myers said the administration is proposing drastic changes in the sugar program because the current high price support is causing adverse trends in the sugar industry He said the current program has artificially stimulated domestic sugar and corn sweetener production which has allowed corn sweeteners to make market inroads U S sugar consumption has declined which has resulted in a progressive contraction of the sugar import quota to only one mln short tons this year he said This has hurt cane sugar refiners who rely on imported sugar processing Furthermore USDA said the current sugar program gives overseas manufacturers of sugar containing products a competitive advantage The result has been higher imports of sugar containing products and a flight of U S processing facilities overseas to take advantage of cheaper sugar USDA also said the current program imposes a heavy cost on U S consumers and industrial users In fiscal USDA said consumers are paying nearly two billion dlrs more than necessary for sugar Enactment of this bill will reduce the price gap between sweeteners and help to correct or stabilize the many adverse impacts and trends which the sugar industry is currently facing Myers said The following table lists the rate of payments in cts per lb to growers and the quantity covered in short tons recoverable raw sugar under the administration s proposal to compensate sugar growers with targeted payments QUANTITY First tons Over to Over to Over to Over to Over to Over to Over to Over tons nil nil nil nil Reuter
