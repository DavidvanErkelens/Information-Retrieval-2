WORLD BANK SUGGESTS MORE OPEN ECONOMY FOR INDIA By Ajoy Sen Reuters NEW DELHI April The World Bank has suggested India should move to a more open economy by gradually removing most government controls on industry and adopting a liberal external trade policy with reduced levels of protection A confidential executive summary of a draft Bank report on the Indian economy was made available to Reuters It suggests liberalisation as part of a package of reforms to boost exports of Indian goods by making them more competitive The summary said These reforms would result in domestic prices much more in line with world prices than is true today and in a greater degree of import competition and export rivalry than the nation has ever seen The summary said foreign trade must play a key role in India s transition towards a more dynamic economy Liberal imports of capital goods would help modernise the economy and expose Indian producers to foreign competition Larger exports would provide the foreign exchange for imports The main guideline is unambiguously to abandon the present principle of unlimited protection for all indigenously available products and to recognise the role of actual or potential competition from imports as a source of discipline on the prices and costs of public and private sector domestic manufacturers the summary said An Indian official told Reuters the government was discussing the report with the Bank A final report with some changes was likely to be ready by May but he declined to give further details The Bank and industrialised nations will discuss the Bank s final report at a meeting in Paris on June and to discuss aid for India in the year starting in June The summary said India s gross domestic product gdp grew at an average five pct in Indian fiscal years and which ended in March It said investment was being sustained at nearly pct of gdp Almost pct of the investment was being financed by national savings mainly from the private sector India s trade deficit is officially said to have narrowed to billion dlrs in ended March from a record billion dlrs in The current account deficit fell to billion dlrs in from billion in But the summary said the improvement was largely due to lower prices of crude oil petroleum products and fertilisers which make up the bulk of India s import bill India was able to save about billion dlrs in foreign exchange in due to lower prices of those products the summary said The Bank s summary said there was little room for complacency in the balance of payments position It said that despite a lower trade deficit in Indian foreign exchange reserves fell by mln dlrs Real export growth would need to average at least pct a year in value terms in the coming years to maintain a viable balance of payments the summary said It did not explicitly suggest the rupee should be devalued India might have to reaffirm the commitment to exporting while undertaking some dramatic changes in general incentives that involve some political costs it said An example of such a policy would be the adoption of an exchange rate regime that maintained exporters profitability the summary said It said such an approach had been successful in countries such as South Korea Colombia and Turkey It would maintain the competitiveness of Indian exports and simultaneously reduce import pressures Earlier this year the Indian government denied that the World Bank asked it to devalue the Indian rupee to boost exports REUTER
