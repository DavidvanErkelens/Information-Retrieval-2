AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT TO PAY SUBSIDIES USDA WASHINGTON March The Australian Government will likely reimburse the Australian Wheat Board AWB about mln U S dlrs to pay wheat farmers for their crop the U S Agriculture Department said In its report on Export Markets for U S Grains the department said the sharp fall in world wheat prices has reduced the export sales revenue of the AWB to levels insufficient to cover its breakeven export price estimated at around dlrs per tonne For example the recent large sales of wheat to China mln tonnes and Egypt mln tonnes were well below the breakeven export price it said Australian wheat farmers normally receive an advance payment known as the Guaranteed Minimum Price GMP calculated at pct of the average of estimated returns in the current year and the two lowest of the previous three years the department said In addition deductions for taxes freight handling and storage are deducted from the GMP the farmer receives But the department said the Australian Bureau of Agricultural Economics BAE predicts wheat production will drop sharply from mln tonnes in to mln in The decline will result from low world grain prices leading to shifts to livestock and other crops which could benefit U S wheat exports the department said Reuter
