SENATE PREPARING FOR NEW U S BUDGET BATTLE By Michael Posner Reuters WASHINGTON April Congress returned from its Easter recess ready for the annual Spring budget battle that promises to be a partisan dispute The budget fight pitting Democrats against President Reagan and Republicans is expected to get underway this week in the Senate late this week and last at least another week It is taking on new prominence because of current trade woes That is because the budget problems and its associated huge deficits are said to be at the root of related international trade friction currently worrying financiers As the dollar slides downward on global markets and stock exchanges gyrate wildly the trade dispute involving the United States and Japan once again is spreading fears of a major trade war between the two trading giants for the first time since World War II Ostensibly that dispute is over U S charges that Japan is refusing to open its markets to semi conductor chips and the resulting U S tariffs doubling prices of Japanese televisions and small computers Behind the elements of a brewing trade war which neither side wants is the dilemma of the U S budget and its deficit Some analysts say the financial markets may be waking up to the economic realities that the huge debt cannot continue to grow without repercussions A large portion of the U S debt has been financed by foreigners from their accumulated trade surpluses But if they withdraw this support the result can only be further problems including higher interest rates for Americans In a nutshell the U S budget process has now moved to the showdown stages in Congress Reagan s own trillion dollar spending budget for the government year starting Oct was trounced badly in the House on April The Senate takes up a plan similar to one that passed the House calling for slashing the deficit from its estimated billion dlr level next year to about billion dlrs through defense and domestic spending cuts and about billion dlrs in new unspecified taxes As the Senate prepares to take up its own budget plan majority Democrats predict there will be passage of a bill only after a protracted partisan battle In the House not one Republican voted for the budget which passed by to In the Senate none of Reagan s Republicans voted for the budget as it passed out of the Senate Budget Committee for full Senate consideration A key Senate Budget Committee source told Reuters he believes this very unusual unanimous opposition was by design among congressional Republicans perhaps with the tacit approval of the White House Republicans want Democrats to take the heat for any tax hikes and defense cuts he said In the coming weeks the source said Democrats will press for a bipartisan budget and seek a negotiated budget with Reagan who already is opposed to the idea But it is not clear how the Republicans will act he added He said Republicans may propose their own plan for lower taxes and more defense spending which they did not offer after Reagan s budget was clobbered in an early vote in the House When Reagan entered the White House in he inherited what was labelled a huge deficit from Jimmy Carter that wound up to be nearly billion dlrs that year Despite Reagan s promise to balance the budget by critics note that his administration s record of accumulated debt is estimated over one trillion dlrs or billion dlrs That is money the government must borrow and pay back and many analysts say it is what kept the dollar high and caused the worst U S trade deficit ever Last year the United States bought goods from the world worth billion dlrs more than what it sold including purchases of billion dlrs in Japanese goods While Congress is trying to attack the trade deficit on one front through a get tough trade bill promising retaliatory measures unless all markets are opened its success so far against the budget deficit has been marked by limited progress Congress which controls the pursestrings has put the deficit on a downward path from its record high of billion dlrs accumulated in fiscal which ended Sept Because of the Gramm Rudman Hollings balanced budget law enacted in late there has been pressure on Congress to do more than talk about deficits That law named after Republican Senators Phil Gramm of Texas Warren Rudman of New Hampshire and Democrat Ernest Hollings of South Carolina calls for a balanced budget by through a series of set deficit targets that Congress must meet The law has been followed even though an enforcement mechanism to mandate automatic across the board cuts if Congress misses its goal was stricken by the Supreme Court The legislators have followed the targets on paper But in reality the goal has actually been missed For example Congress last year approved legislation to meet the target of a billion dlr deficit But even after approving the numbers the deficit for is estimated at over billion dlrs far off the target This year the target is billion dlrs and that goal is expected to be missed widely Reuter
